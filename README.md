# Synchronization Demonstration

This project contains two Java classes that demonstrate different synchronization techniques in multi-threaded environments. The classes are designed to illustrate potential deadlock situations and how to resolve them using different synchronization mechanisms.

## Classes

1. `ResolveDeadLockTest`: Demonstrates a potential deadlock situation using synchronized blocks.
2. `ReentrantLockExample`: Shows how to use `ReentrantLock` to avoid deadlock.

## ResolveDeadLockTest

This class demonstrates a classic deadlock scenario using synchronized blocks. It contains:

- Two inner classes: `ResourceA` and `ResourceB`, representing shared resources.
- Two threads that attempt to acquire locks on both resources in different orders.
- Potential for deadlock when both threads hold one resource and wait for the other.

### Key Points:
- Uses `synchronized` keyword for locking.
- Demonstrates how improper lock ordering can lead to deadlock.

## ReentrantLockExample

This class shows an alternative approach using `ReentrantLock` from the `java.util.concurrent` package. It includes:

- Similar `ResourceA` and `ResourceB` inner classes.
- Use of `ReentrantLock` instead of synchronized blocks.
- A technique to avoid deadlock by acquiring locks in a consistent order.

### Key Points:
- Uses `ReentrantLock` for more flexible locking.
- Demonstrates a strategy to prevent deadlock by acquiring locks in a specific order.

## Purpose

These classes serve as educational examples to:
1. Demonstrate different synchronization techniques in Java.
2. Illustrate potential synchronization problems, particularly deadlock.
3. Show solutions to avoid deadlock situations.

## Usage

To run these examples:

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```
javac ResolveDeadLockTest.java
javac ReentrantLockExample.java
   ```

2. Run each class:
   ```
java ResolveDeadLockTest
java ReentrantLockExample
   ```

3. Observe the output and behavior of each program.

## Notes

- `ResolveDeadLockTest` may result in a deadlock. If the program seems to hang, this is demonstrating the deadlock condition.
- `ReentrantLockExample` should complete without deadlock, demonstrating a solution to the problem.

These examples are for educational purposes and demonstrate basic concepts of thread synchronization and deadlock prevention in Java.

This README provides an overview of the two classes, their purpose, key points about each implementation, instructions for usage, and some notes about what to expect when running the programs. It's designed to give users a clear understanding of what the code demonstrates and how to use it for learning about synchronization techniques and problems.
